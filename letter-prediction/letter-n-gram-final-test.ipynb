    "After testing the majority voting algorithm, we discussed the possibility of hitting a plateau for such a simple model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, we concluded that, in a language, it is mandatory that the set of words is finite. Should we worry about overfitting to split the dataset? From the moment we have a big population of combination of prefixes, the samples might not be necessary. If we remove the most frequent words, we are not avoiding overfitting, but we are removing important data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, for a last test, we are going to approach creating a final dataset with a big conversational vocab, and smooth it with a sort of \"Laplace smoothing\", by also scanning the most frequent words of the language once. Then, we will test by training with a split, and then without to see the effects of \"overfitting\"."
